 Notes Management Applications

This repository contains three different implementations of a notes management system:
Single-Tier (SQLite-based standalone script)
Two-Tier (MySQL database with Python backend)
Three-Tier (Flask-based web application with database and frontend)


 1. Single-Tier Application
 Overview
- A simple Python script that stores notes in an SQLite database.
- Allows adding notes via a command-line interface.

 How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.

2. Import the `notes_db.sql` file into MySQL.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh

 3. Three-Tier Application
 Overview
